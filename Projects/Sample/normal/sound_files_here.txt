# SYNTHEA SOUND FOLDER #

In this folder go the sound files for your project board. By default, this folder is called “normal”.

Sound boards can have multiple copies of sound folders, if the entire board is to be changed. In that case, a folder will exist for each copy of the board. Most users will never need to worry about this.

Most reliable sound file formats are OGG and WAV. 44.1KHz and 16-bit are standard, success with other settings may vary.
